\chapter{Introduction}
Wikipedia (WP) is the biggest source of information you can find on the internet, there are more
than 6 million articles and they are all maintained by volunteers. The value of Wikipedia is all in
the hands of the editors.

Many articles mean many users and therefore many potential conflicts. Avoiding these conflicts is
the best way for this encyclopedia to develop. \\ 
Each Wikipedia page has four different sections:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Article: the actual content of the page.
    \item Talk Page: a forum where people can talk about edits. 
    \item History: a place where everyone can see the older versions of the pages.
    \item Source: in this section users can edit the page. 
\end{itemize}

Conflicts could happen both on the Talk page, through a discussion, and in the Article, through an
edit war. It is important to analyze all these aspects

\section{Main Project}
\label{sec:Main Project}
The project our team is working on, in collaboration between Eurecat and the Wikimedia Foundation,
is named: "Community Health Metrics: Understanding Editor Drop-off", this is a part of the
project idea : \\

“The primary value of Wikipedia is the editors. When an editor leaves the project, we lose their
participation and contribution to the community, This could be related to multiple factors, also
external to the project, but it could signal an issue related to internal dynamics and to the health
of the community. While a big effort was dedicated to retain new editors, we lack knowledge and
initiatives focused on understanding and preventing drop-off for experienced editors.”
\\

As stated in the description of the project, the focus is on the experienced users, which are the
core of Wikipedia: there are 41,741,926 Wikipedia accounts but the active users are only 132,916
namely

~ 3\% of all users. 

Focusing on this category of users and understanding the reasons that lead to a drop-off can give a
big help to WP. Several people are working on this project, this work is just a part of the whole.
In the team, everyone is working on a specific topic with the idea of then merging the different
results to obtain an analysis of the phenomenon from different points of view in order to have a
greater understanding of the life cycle of users.  

The prevention of the drop-off is not the only goal of the project, improving the community health
is also important to let users be in a good environment without being held back from editing. 

\section{My Contribution}
\label{sec:project}
The topic explored in this study is the revert analysis - i.e., when the version of a page is
restored to that of a specific date - for all the articles of Wikipedia.

This project consisted of the analysis of the edit history of different language editions of
Wikipedia to study patterns of reverts and edit wars to understand their potential effect on
individual user activity.

I implemented state-of-the-art metrics of controversy based on reverts and mutual reverts and
developed a new metric based on revert chains. Metrics have been computed per page and per user
monthly.

The results can be viewed in an interactive dashboard avaiable online.
\section{Releated Work}
There are different works that involves reverts: An interesting tool that allows to visualize the
conflicts~\cite{Suh2007} the problem is that it is from 2007 and wikipedia started growing around
2010 now that there are new technologies and much more data to analyze we can reach more interesting
conclusions. There have been analysis on antisocial behavior caused by vandalism~\cite{Kiesel2017}
but since the focus of the project is on experienced users this is not relevant for this study.
